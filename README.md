Created a REST API in nodejs with mongodb as database for creating tasks with a duration (in minutes). 
User can insert a todo record with a sample schema like:
- task name
- task description
- creator
- duration
- createdAt

- Once a data is created with a duration, it will be automatically deleted after the assigned duration.
